## Change Procedure

Proposed additions to the schema should be created to a branch of
*master* and a pull request should be opened.  Once the addition
has been approved by PASSCAL it will be merged with the master
branch and included in the next release.

For discussion of a potential change without creating a branch
an issue should be created.  If the issue is likely to result in 
changes to the schema it is recommended that the individual or
organization proposing the change to do so in a branch for review.

Changes and issues should only be grouped together when logically
related in order to streamline review and acceptance.
